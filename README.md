## About Me

I design and build embedded systems that connect real-world electrical signals to scalable digital architectures.

My core focus areas include:

- Low-level firmware development in C  
- Hardware-software integration  
- Real-time data acquisition  
- Smart Sensors  
- IoT telemetry architectures using MQTT  

I work across both **microcontroller-based systems (nRF52, STM32, ESP32)** and **Linux-based embedded platforms (Raspberry Pi)**, building complete solutions from hardware measurement to networked data streaming.

## 🔬 Featured Project

### 🔌 Multi-Rail Power Monitoring System (PAC194x + Raspberry Pi)

**Tech Stack:** Embedded C • Linux I²C (`i2c-dev`) • MQTT (Mosquitto, Paho)

- Implemented register-level communication with PAC194x power monitor ICs
- Reconstructed multi-byte big-endian register data
- Converted raw ADC values into calibrated voltage, current, and power
- Validated measurements using shunt resistors and multimeter cross-checks
- Streamed telemetry over MQTT in JSON format
- Designed scalable topic-based architecture for IoT dashboards

**Monitored Rails:**
- 3.3 V  
- 1.2 V  
- 5 V  

This project demonstrates system-level thinking: hardware validation, firmware reliability, and scalable communication design.
